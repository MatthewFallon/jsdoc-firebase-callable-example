# Backend API Callables

This site maps out the backend for Apps to call to through firebase functions.

## Callables

All the functions you will need to access will be found under Callables in the menu sidebar. Please reference the [Firebase Callable docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable?hl=en) when calling these functions. You will see a context object mentioned in these docs, but that will only be for the backend, clients only need to send the correct data object and the function will return the output or error as listed. Any types that are firebase types will link to the relevant documentation in firebase, please follow the "see" links from each type to reach those references.
